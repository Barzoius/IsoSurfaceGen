## Marching Cubes on uniform grids

The Marching Cubes algorithm (Lorensen & Cline, 1987) works
by following the next steps:

### 1. Dividing the 3D space into a grid of cubes.

This is straightforward. We simply divide the 
required space into a grid of cubes (voxels). 
This can be done by calculating the surface's 
bounding box or choosing an arbitrary size that 
encapsulates the shape.For simplicity,
I chose the second method.

### 2. Evaluating our implicit surface at each voxelâ€™s corners.
