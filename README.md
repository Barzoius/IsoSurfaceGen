## Marching Cubes on uniform grids

The Marching Cubes algorithm (Lorensen & Cline, 1987) works
by following the next steps:

### 1. Dividing the 3D space into a grid of cubes.

This is straightforward. We simply divide the 
required space into a grid of cubes (voxels). 
This can be done by calculating the surface's 
bounding box or choosing an arbitrary size that 
encapsulates the shape.For simplicity,
I chose the second method.

### 2. Evaluating our implicit surface at each voxelâ€™s corners.

First, we evaluate the surface at each voxel's corner to see if it falls inside or outside the surface. Based on that, we create a binary index for each grid cell by concatenating the inside/outside classification of its eight corners in a fixed order.

For a cube with corners labeled 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-0, each corner contributes a 1 if it is inside the surface and 0 if it is outside. This forms an 8-bit binary number, where the most significant bit corresponds to corner 7 and the least significant bit to corner 0.

For example, if corners 7, 6, 5 and 4 are inside the surface, while the rest are outside, the binary index is 11110000(=240).
